  <p>Hello! My name is 2415, and I am a teacher. I created this website to help students and beginners learn the basics of HTML and web development in a simple and easy way.</p>

  <p>Teaching is my passion, and I believe in making learning fun and clear. Through this website, I want to share helpful tutorials, small projects, and simple examples that anyone can understand — even if they are just starting.</p>

  <p>Here you will find basic HTML topics, navigation examples, contact pages, and other beginner-level web design content. Everything is written in easy words for better understanding.</p>

  <p>My goal is to support learners and help them grow step by step. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me through the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting, and happy learning!</p>
